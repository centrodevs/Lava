## Usage

### How to run?

First, you need to make sure some basic python modules have been installed. To do this, please use:

```sh
$ pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

For instance, `pip install nltk` would install the python NLP package.

Then, you can git clone the project from our [GitHub](https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-San-Jose-2016/Repo-11) page:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-San-Jose-2016/Repo-11.git
```
(Of course, if you are using SSH as the github credentials, please use `git clone git@github.com:Opportunity-Hack-San-Jose-2016/Repo-11.git`.)

Finally, to run the server (**note**: you need Python 2.7, not 3.5 to do this):

```sh
$ cd centroLavaApp
$ python run.py [PORT]
...
```

And eventually, you can open your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox recommended) and type in `localhost:[PORT]`. You can configure this port number; if nothing is supplied, it will default to `5099`.
